                     There are many theories about how Loki came to be among the pantheon of Norse deities and about his role in the Norse myths.
                     They range from Loki originating as a fire god to Loki as a hypostasis of Odin. I agree with, and will attempt to support below, another theory that,
                     while he may be a god of fire, he is more importantly an archetypal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster_god">trickster</a> god. He is a chaotic element that, while destructive,
                     allows otherwise rigid situations to change and grow. Though his scheming and double-dealing often cause problems, they also result in a
                     lot of useful tools and technology both <a href="file:///Users/ptwickler/Desktop/html_class/final_project/stories.html#hammer">magical</a> and <a href="file:///Users/ptwickler/Desktop/html_class/final_project/stories.html#wall">mundane</a>. To the Aesir, he is the "Other," a jotun who, though he chooses to live among them, seems to
                     take every opportunity to cause them harm.

						 Loki was born to a Jotun father, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fárbauti">Farbauti</a>, and a mother, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laufey">Laufey</a>, who is
						 either a tree goddess or some other sort of nature spirit. Her name, Laufey can be translated as "full of leaves," or "leaf island," a kenning for "tree." Farbauti translates as "dangerour hitter"
						 giving support to the idea of Loki's origin as a fire god, arising from the dangerous lightning hitting a tree. Loki may have starte out as a
						 personification or god of fire, but this aspect of him seems to have faded over time or to have been metaphorical to begin with.
						 His personality certainly resembles fire: powerful and useful but fundamentally fickle and capable of indiscriminate destruction.

                         Although Loki may have started out as a Jotun, or half-jotun, he is usually listed as one of the Aesir. Certainly, the myths that survive
                         make it seem like he spent most, if not all, of his time with them. As a testament to his charm, and perhaps Odin's sometimes flawed character,
                         Odin made Loki his blood-brother when they were both young. In Viking society, this would have given Loki the same standing
                         among the Aesir as a natural brother of Odin. Indeed, some authors editorialize when they relate tales of the harsh treatment the other
                         gods visited upon Loki by saying that it wasn't proper to treat him that way. Some sources go as far as to suggest that
                         the gods, in part, brought Ragnarok upon themselves as sort of a karmic retribution for their failure to respect Loki's relationship with Odin.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         In their defense, Loki gave the Aesir plenty of cause to him roughly. Among the stories of Loki's more light-hearted mischief, stand the
                         the stories about his downright dark and evil deeds. In one <a href="file:///Users/ptwickler/Desktop/html_class/final_project/stories.html#baldur">tale</a>, Loki first tricks one of the gods into killing
                         the god of light, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur">Baldur</a>, and then disguises himself as an old woman and refuses to help free Baldur from the
                         underworld, ultimately consigning him to death permanently. In another, Loki breeds with a giantess who gives birth to three monstrous children. The first, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenris">Fenris</a>, is a giant wolf
                         that becomes so huge and vicious that the gods enlist the help of the dwarves to create a magical fetter to bind him. During Ragnarok, he will break free
                         and kill Odin. The second, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jörmungandr">Jormungandr</a>, is a sea serpent so large that he encircles all of
                         Midgard with his tail in his mouth. He, too, will rise up during Ragnarok, killing Thor before he himself is slain. Finally, Loki's third child,
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hel_(mythology)">Hel</a>, is the ruler of the <a href="./gods_and_worlds.html#worlds_hel">world</a> that bears her name. During Ragnarok, Hel
                         will lead an army of the inglorious dead into battle against the Aesir.

                          So, Loki was a pain in the neck. Why did the Aesir tolerate him? Many scholars, and me, maintain believers in gods and myths
                          do so to fill some sort of spiritual or psychological need either in themselves or in their society.
                          I say that the Norse gods tolerated Loki because they needed him and they needed him because the ancient Scandinavians
                          needed him. Why? Because the archetype of the trickster can be a powerful force for growth, progress, and good.

                       From the perspective of modern, Western, ordered societies, the trickster is problematic as best. To many of us,
                       Loki comes across as a wholly destructive character. Constantly causing problems,
                       both innocuous and malign, breaking his word, and convincing the other Aesir to participate
                       in his less-than-honorable escapades.

                       These louche interludes, however upsetting, offensive, dangerous, or destructive they may be,
                       almost always result in a very material benefit. When he <a href="./stories.html	#wall">cheats</a> to prevent a jotun in disguises
                       from taking Freya, the sun and the moon as payment, Odin's eight-legged horse, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleipnir#attestations">Sleipnir</a> is the result.
                       In another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mjoellnir#Norse_mythology">story</a> he makes outrageous boasts and, foolishly, wagers his head with a dwarf that the dwarf and his brother could
                        never make objects as powerful as those made by another set of dwarven smiths. He looses the bet when the challenged smiths make, among other things,
                        Mjoellnir, Thor's hammer. This pattern repeats itself again and again throughout the Norse myths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As the <em>Poetic Edda</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hávamál#Gesta.C3.BE.C3.A1ttr">says</a>,
                      <blockquote>
                      Cattle die,<br/>
                      kinsmen die<br/>
                      you yourself die;<br/>
                      I know one thing<br/>
                      which never dies:<br/>
                      the fate of the honored dead.<br/>
                      </blockquote>
                      In this spirit, Loki's efforts become darker and darker and bear more and more bitter fruit.
                      In the end of the mythological cycle Loki orchestrates Baldur's death and has a
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki#Lokasenna">nasty spat</a> with the Aesir
                      that finally alienates them for good. When Ragnarok finally comes, Loki's children, Fenris,
                      Jormungandr, and Hel all fulfill their destructive promise and kill the Aesir.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Modern readers have often pointed to this as a form of final testimony
                     as to Loki's evil, destructive nature. I posit, however,
                     the ancient Scandinavians saw Ragnarok as a natural part
                     of the cosmic tale. The events that lead to Ragnarok, those of
                     Loki's doing and others, are woven throughout the Norse myths
                     such that, even though it is doubtful they were written in
                     any kind of chronological sequence,it is clear that, in the
                     collective unconscious of the Norse, there was never a time
                     when the end was not inevitable. Hence, while unfortunate,
                     Loki's role was a necessary one in the psychology of the Norse.
                     The end must come, someone must help it end.
