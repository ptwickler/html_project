        <p>The mythology of ancient Scandinavia divided the universe into nine worlds each populated by a particular tribe of beings. The myths and stories that have survived to the present day primarily concern the doings of four of these tribes: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/%C3%86sir">Ã†sir</a> gods, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Vanir">Vanir</a> gods, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/J%C3%B6tunn">Jotuns</a>, and humans. While each tribe tended to hang out in their home world, individuals did travel between the worlds fairly often and much of the action of the myths take place on our world (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Midgard">Midgard</a>, or "middle-earth"). Below, I provide a few details about the nine worlds and the four main tribes that dwell there.</p>

Asgard is surrounded by a partially incomplete wall (more on that <a href="./stories.html">later</a>) which protects the gods from their enemies, the Jotun.

While the sources are ambiguous about the exact breakdown between Aesir, elves, Vanir, and dwarves, light elves are J.R.R. Tolkien type elves. Included with the light elves are things like pixies and brownies.

              Vanaheim is home to the Vanir gods. The Vanir are a tribe of gods that hold sway over fertility and nature. The Aesir and Vanir had a war in their early days and two of the Aesir, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyr">Frey</a> and his sister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyja">Freyja</a> ended up staying among the Aesir as hostages (part of the peace process). Frey is a fertility god of the virility, sunshine, good weather, and sacral kingship. Freya is also responsible for fertility, more specifically she is the goddess of love, feminine fertility, sex, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei%C3%B0r">magic</a>.
           </p>
            <p>
              One theory holds that the Vanir were the gods of an earlier group of inhabitants of Northern Europe which the Germanic/Norse tribes displaced or assimilated when they moved in during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_period">migration period</a>. The Vanir, then, be considered syncretized forms of the earlier gods much the same way as some Native American gods were transformed into Christian saints.

            <p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunheimr">Jotunheim</a><img src="./jotun_thor2.jpg" id="jotun_thor" class="illustration" alt="a jotun/giant and Thor" name="jotun_thor">.jpg dwell the race of frost, storm, and ice giants called the Jotuns. Jotuns are the primary adversary of the Aesir. As they did with the Vanir, the Aesir had a war with the Jotuns and it seems that Thor, one of the most important Norse gods, has as his primary responsibility killing jotuns. Jotuns are, generally, crude, vicious, primitive, barbarians. However, they are occasionally beautiful (in the case of the women) and wise (in the case of the men). In addition, some are sorcerers powerful enough to confound the gods (at least when it makes a good plot device). For example, although Loki is definitely a member of the Aesir, he is, in fact, a jotun. Many of Loki's attributes and abilities (such as the ability to change his shape at will, propensity for lying and causing mayhem, and eagerness to hurt or humiliate the Aesir) are prototypically jotun.</p>
            <p>As with the Vanir, some scholars believe that the jotun were, originally, another group of gods supplanted by the Aesir at some point.</p>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard">Midgard</a>, literally translates to "middle enclosure," is the world of humans. In practice, Midgard is the known, inhabited world as understood by the Scandinavians in the Middle-Ages. In sources, for instance, Jotunheim is described as lying to the east of Midgard which suggests that if one travelled far enough, one might end up in Jotunheim (rather than Russia or Asia as was actually the case).

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muspelheim">Muspelheim</a> is a realm of fire and the home of the fire-giants. Like the jotuns, the fire giants are depicted as savage destroyers and the enemies of the Aesir and Vanir. Surtr, the ruler of Muspelheim, plays a large role in the Norse apocalypse, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a>, at which time he breaks into Asgard and/or Midgard to destroy everything.

            In contrast to Muspelheim, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niflheim">Niflheim</a>, is a world of ice, mist, and frost. Before all the other worlds came into being, there was a primordial void between Niflheim and Muspelheim, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginnungagap">Ginnungagap</a>. Fire from Muspelheim and ice from Niflheim swirled into Ginnungagap and combined to form a giant cow and the largest jotun ever. Long story short, from the gap, jotun, and cow came all the gods, jotuns, dwarves, elves, and worlds.

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svartalfheim">Svartalfheim</a> is the home to the "dark elves" or dwarves. In this case the "dark" refers to the fact that they live in the dark not that they are evil or dark in character. The dwarves are generally reclusive, a little greedy, and surly, but they are also the finest craftspeople anywhere and can take credit for making such famous artifacts as Thor's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir">hammer</a> and Odin's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gungnir">spear</a>.

Not to be confused with the Christian realm of the damn with two "L's," the Norse version was unpleasant, but not torturous. According to some sources, pretty much anyone who doesn't die in battle ends up in Hel.
