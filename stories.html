        Loki's Bet and Origin of Thor's Hammer
      </div><!-- end section head -->
      <div class="section_content"><!-- start section content -->
        <p>In this story, Loki bets his head with Sindri and his brother Brokkr that they could never succeed in making items more beautiful than those of the Sons of Ivaldi (the dwarves who created other precious items for the gods including Odin's spear Gungnir, and Freyr's foldable boat Skíðblaðnir).</p>
        <p>Sindri and Brokkr accept Loki's bet and the two brothers begin working. They begin to work in their workshop and Eitri puts a pig's skin in the forge and tells his brother (Brokkr) never to stop working the bellows until he comes to take out what he put in. Loki, in disguise as a fly, comes and bites Brokkr on the arm. Nevertheless, he continues to pump the bellows.Then, Sindri takes out Gullinbursti, Freyr's boar with shining bristles.</p>
        <p>Next, Sindri puts some gold in the forge and gives Brokkr the same order. Again, Loki, still in the guise of a fly comes and, again, bites Brokkr's neck twice as hard as he had bitten his arm. Just as before, Brokkr continues to work the bellows despite the pain. When Sindri returns, he takes out Draupnir, Odin's ring, which drops nine duplicates of itself every ninth night.</p>
        <p>Finally, Sindri puts some iron in the forge and tells Brokkr not to stop pumping the bellows. Loki comes a third time and this time bites Brokkr on the eyelid even harder. The bite is so deep that it draws blood. The blood runs into Brokkr's eyes and forces him stop working the bellows just long enough to wipe his eyes. This time, when Sindri returns, he takes Mjöllnir out of the forge.</p>
        <p>The handle is shorter than Sindri had planned and so the hammer can only be wielded with one hand. Despite the flaw in the handle, Sindri and Brokkr win the bet and go to take Loki's head. However, Loki worms his way out of the bet by pointing out that the dwarves would need to cut his neck to remove his head, but Loki's neck was not part of the deal. As a consolation prize Brokkr sews Loki's mouth shut to teach him a lesson.</p>

        The Theft of Thor's Hammer
      </div><!-- end section head -->
      <div class="section_content"><!-- start section content -->
        <p>
        Loki did not always use his wits to do the gods ill. Once it happened that Thor awoke to find that his
        hammer was missing. He turned to Loki for help in finding it. Loki and Thor went to Freya and asked
        to borrow her feather cloak that lets the wearer turn into a hawk. Freya readily agrees when she
        hears that Thor's hammer is missing and Loki flies off to look for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Jotunheim, Loki comes across the jotun Thrym plaiting gold collars for his dogs and trimming
        the manes of his horses. He asks what could be going on such that Loki would be alone in Jotunheim.
         Loki mentions the theft of Thor's hammer at which point Thrym reveals that he has taken it and hidden it
         and will only return it if Freya agrees to marry him.
      </p>
      <p>
         Loki returns to Asgard and breaks the news to Freya who flies into a rage and
         refuses to marry the jotun. The gods hold a meeting to discuss the problem.
         <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdall">Heimdall</a> suggests that Thor and
         Loki travel to Thrym's hall in Jotunheim after dressing Thor up as a bride,
         complete with a full veil, and wearing Freya's necklace.
      </p>
      <p>
         Loki and Thor agree, dress up Thor, and head off to Thrym's hall. Once there,
         Thrym falls for the trick and the wedding proceeds. Just before the ceremony, Loki
         cleverly tells Thrym that Freya is eager to marry but wants to swear her wedding vows
         on Thor's hammer. Thrym agrees and places Mjoelnir in his "bride's" lap.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once the hammer is in Thor's hand, he tears off his veil and proceeds to destroy Thrym and his guests.

        Loki and the Wall Around Asgard and the Origin of Sleipnir
      </div><!-- end section head -->
      <div class="section_content"><!-- start section content -->
        <p>At some point early in the history of the Aesir, they fought a war with the jotuns. Eventually, they defeated them, though not without suffering casualties and property damage. One major piece of damage was the protective wall around Asgard fell to one of the jotuns' attacks.</p>
        <p>In the <em>Prose Edda</em>, the author claims that the Aesir were fond of building with fine materials, like gold, silver, and precious stones, but less so of working with plain stone. So, when a man appeared and offered to build a new wall around Asgard, the Aesir were eager to here his terms. They were this: He would build a wall around Asgard and, in exchange, the Aesir would give him the sun, the moon, and Freya.</p>
        <p>Initially, the gods were ready to laugh him off or kill him for his arrogance. Loki, however, proposed that they take him up on his offer, but limit the timeframe to three seasons and that he could not have any other person help him. That way, when he failed, the Aesir would have at least some of the wall built at no cost to themselves. The Aesir were convinced and came to terms with the builder.</p>
        <p>Right away, things seemed a little off to the Aesir. The builder worked tirelessly day and night with the help of a horse who also seemed indefatigable. As time passed, the builder completed an uncomfortably large amount of the wall. When it became clear that he would, indeed, finish before the deadline was up, the gods went to Loki and ordered him to get them out of the mess he had convinced them to get into.</p>
        <p>This Loki did in a very tricksterish fashion. He turned himself into a mare and lured away the builder's draft horse. Without his horse, the builder couldn't finish in time.</p>
        <p>The gods confronted him and he flew into a rage, tearing apart the wall he had built with his bare hands. In his anger, the builder revealed his true nature: he was a jotun in disguise. So, too, it turned out was his horse. Not only did this explain how he could work so hard so long, but it gave the Aesir an "out." They had been deceived and so the normal rules of honor and hospitality were void. They immediately called in Thor who proceeded to do what he does best, namely, obliterate jotuns with his hammer.</p>
        <p>The wall was still mostly built, despite the jotun's efforts to tear it down again, and the sun, moon and Freya were safe and sound. All in all, the Aesir counted it as a win and their anger at Loki was quickly forgotten.</p>
        <p>Loki, however, went missing for about nine months and when he returned, he was leading a fine, eight-legged foal. He gave the horse to Odin, who named him Sleipnir. The horse grew into the fastest, strongest horse that ever lived, capable of running through the sky as well as on land.</p>

        Baldur's Death
      </div><!-- end section head -->
      <div class="section_content"><!-- start section content -->
        <p>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr">Baldur</a>, the god of day, or light in some reckonings, had a dream which portended his death.
          In order to prevent him from ever dying, his mother, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg">Frigg</a>, made everything in nature
          promise never to harm Baldur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loki heard about this, and through his cunning, got Frigg to let it slip that she had not made the mistletoe promise as it seemed too weak and
        innocent. Right away, Loki went out and gathered some mistletoe, fashioning it
        into an arrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the gods had gathered around Baldur and were taking turns pelting
        him with stones and spears and arrows, rejoicing in the fact that they all just
        bounced off of him harmlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loki noticed, however, that Baldur's brother Hoder, who was blind, was not able to
        take part in the festivities. Loki sidled up to Hoder and asked him why he wasn't
        taking part. Hoder replied that it was because he couldn't see Baldur to
        throw or shoot anything at him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loki, with malice in his heart, offered to guide Hoder's hand in shooting a bow
        and arrow. Hoder took Loki up on his offer unaware that Loki had knocked his
        mistletoe arrow into Hoder's bow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hapless Hoder fired the arrow, but instead of bouncing off, it pierced Baldur's
        heart and he died. In the aftermath, Loki slipped away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gods gave Baldur a proper Viking funeral: loading his ship with all his treasure, his weapons, and his horse. The ship was so large,
        however, that the gods could not launch it. They for the giantess Hyrrokkin who came riding on a wolf using twisted
        serpents as a bridle. She pushed the ship so hard that smoke and flame sprung from the rollers as it slid into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gods were heartbroken. Frigg, asked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermóðr">Hermod</a> to ride to Hel and beg her to
        release Baldur back to the living. Hermod rode to the underworld and did his best to convince Hel to do as the gods wished.
        She refused, however, unless every thing in creation would weep for Baldur.
      </p>
      <p>
         Upon hearing the news, Frigg became hopeful. As she did when she made them promise not to harm Baldur, Frigg went to every
         plant, stone, animal, and person and, pleading her case, got them to weep for Baldur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything was going fine until Frigg came upon a giantess named <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Þökk">Thoekk</a>.
        When she approached the old giantess, and plead her case, Thoekk sneered and replied "What has Baldur ever done for me?"
      </p>
      <p>
          Nothing Frigg could say would sway the old crone. At last, Frigg relented and Baldur remained in Hel's kingdom until Ragnarok. As soon as Frigg was out of sight,
          Thoekk changed her shape revealing that it had been Loki in disguise all along.
      </p>
