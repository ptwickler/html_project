        Introduction

        <p>Among the various gods and goddesses of the various mythologies of the world, my favorite set of myths are those of ancient Scandinavia: the Norse myths. Of the all the gods, goddesses, giants, trolls, elves, dwarves, and humans told of in the Norse myths Loki, the god of mischief, lord of the Jotuns, blood-brother of Odin, and father of monsters, stands out as one of the most complex and, to my way of thinking, characters.</p>
        <p>Popular culture usually portrays Loki as evil, as it does with many of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster">trickster</a> gods scattered about the world's myths. He was born, not of the main group of gods, the Aesir, but of the front-giants, the Jotuns (who are largely gruff, violent, destructive, rude, and ugly) and so is often convicted by guilt of association. Here, however, I would like to assert that, while Loki certainly does reprehensible, troublesome, and sometimes "evil" things, he is also the source of much good for both humanity and the gods. The trickster's archetypal role is that of instigator of change. This change, however, is not always asked for and not always pleasant.</p>

        Structure and Content of This Site

      <div class="section_content"><!-- start .section_content -->
        <p>I have divided this site into several pages on which I discuss different aspects of Loki and Norse mythology in general. On the <a href="./stories.html">Stories</a> page, I have included brief versions of some of the stories about Loki both to provide context and to illustrate some of the assertions I make. You can jump from one section to another using the navigation pane on the left-hand side of your window. I have linked any names or terms I believe may be unknown or of greater interest to the reader to their corresponding Wikipedia entries.</p>

        <p>I created this site as a place to talk about Norse Mythology and my favorite of the Norse gods, Loki. As this is not really intended as a work of scholarship, I have not included footnotes or references. All the information on this site comes either from my own studies into Norse mythology, or for the particularly arcane pieces of information, the Wikipedia.</p>
